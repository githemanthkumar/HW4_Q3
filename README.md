# HW4_Q3
The script implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch to generate handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It defines two neural networks: a Generator, which creates fake images from random noise, and a Discriminator, which classifies images as real (from MNIST) or fake (from the Generator). The GAN is trained through an alternating process: the Generator tries to fool the Discriminator, while the Discriminator learns to differentiate real and fake images. The script generates sample images at epochs 0, 50, and 100, and tracks the losses of both networks over time.
